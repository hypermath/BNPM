Requests: 

  * Please don't use this code for commercial applications without
    asking first.
  * If you publish results using this code, please cite 
    	Network structure exploration via bayesian nonparametric models 
  * Please feel free to contact me for feedback and bug fixes.


Contents: this folder contains basic functions needed for BNPM to run.
Please read the "Network structure exploration via bayesian nonparametric models" paper.

Algorithm notes:
  * Code should be correct but is not heavily optimised. 
  * Samples are considered in a random order within each iteration to
    avoid ordering bias in the data.

Usage:

  * Run runBNPM.m 
  * Adapt load_settings.m to your needs.  

The code seems to work. No promises about bugs though. Please let me know 
about bugs you may find and I will try to fix them.

Input file: *.tuple
Such as karate.tuple
34
1	2
1	3

"34" denotes the node number, "1	2" denotes an edge from node 1 to 2. Notice that the node id 
should be consecutive numbers from 1 to N.

Output file: BNPM-*.txt
The partition group of each nodes.

Golden file: *.txt
The golden partition group of each nodes.
